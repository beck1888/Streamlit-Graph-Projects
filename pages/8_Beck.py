It calculates an average amount of violations received for each type of cuisine. Then, it graphs them in
different colors where red is the most violations and green is the fewest.
What I am proud of is how I calculated the average violations per cuisine type. It took a lot of time
because I had to try different methods to do this. I did this by using dictionaries to keep track of the
number of received violations, and every time a cuisine is seen again, updating its average. 
What I overcame was formatting the graph. I struggled to get the labels and bars right because there was so
much data, but trial and error was able to get me there. Also, there was one category of restaurants (caf√©s)
which encountered an error where the accent would cause the text to display all weird, so I had to create a function
to remove those pesky accent marks."""
